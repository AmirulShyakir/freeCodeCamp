          The Singapore Grand Prix is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.

          Formula 1’s first night race has firmly established itself as one of F1’s premier destinations thanks to its spectacular location on public roads set against a backdrop of the spectacular Singapore skyline, slick marketing and big name concerts.

          The Singapore Grand Prix has enjoyed strong financial support from the local government and recently signed a new long-term contract to remain on the schedule until at least 2028, which will mark the 20th anniversary of the inaugural event.

While neighbouring Malaysia lost its place on the Formula 1 calendar in 2018 due to big financial losses, the Singapore Grand Prix continues to be a success and is a big draw for tourism in the city-state. The event attracts over 30,000 international fans to Singapore each September.

While the inaugural race at Marina Bay Street Circuit attracted a weekend attendance figure of 300,000, spectator numbers suffered a short period of decline in the 2010s, reaching an all-time low of 218,000 in 2016. Since then numbers have hovered around 260,000. The coronavirus pandemic saw the Singapore Grand Prix cancelled in both 2020 and 2021. The event returned in 2022 and had record-breaking spectator numbers.

          The 2023 Singapore Grand Prix is expected to have major changes in the layout, with Turns 16–19 set to be temporarily removed to facilitate the construction of NS Square. Instead, there will be a new flat-out section until turn 16 (currently turn 20), with number of laps increasing from 61 to 63 and lap times to decrease by approximately twenty seconds. Race distance is expected to be covered by one half an hour unlike previous editions usually lasting until the two hours time limit.
